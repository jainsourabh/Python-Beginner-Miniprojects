# Python-Beginner-Miniprojects

# This mini-project idea was mentioned on http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/

# This python script simulates a rolling dice game. It asks user to input two positive integers as a proxy for minimum and maximum face of a dice and it prints a random output between (inclusive) given integers. 

# This is the first version of the script. It is not written keeping any efficinecy in mind. In future, I will add high level functions and GUI to improve this script.
